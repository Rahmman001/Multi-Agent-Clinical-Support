## Utilities

| Command              | What it does                                                |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| /gsd-quick [desc]    | Execute small ad-hoc task with GSD quality guarantees       |
| /gsd-progress        | Pulse check: Current state, roadblocks, and next steps      |
| /gsd-help            | Show this help message                                      |

## Typical Workflow

1. /gsd-new-project     → Set up project vision, requirements, roadmap
2. /gsd-discuss 1       → Capture your preferences for Phase 1
3. /gsd-plan 1          → Research and create task plans
4. /gsd-execute 1       → Execute plans with atomic commits
5. /gsd-verify 1        → Test and verify the work
6. Repeat for next phase

💡 TIP: Start a NEW CONVERSATION between each step
for optimal context freshness and reduced hallucination risk.

## 🛡️ Anti-Hallucination Features

GSD for Antigravity includes built-in safeguards against AI hallucination
that work across ALL models (Claude, Gemini, GPT, open-source):

| Protection                    | How it works                                           |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| File-First Context            | Always re-read files — never rely on memory            |
| Source Verification           | Technical claims verified via docs before use in plans |
| Confidence Levels             | Research tagged HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW by verification source |
| Verification Gates            | Every task verified — output read, not assumed         |
| No Auto-Pass                  | Tests never marked passed without user confirmation    |
| Decision Attribution          | Tracks USER-decided vs AI-suggested decisions          |
| Context Freshness             | New conversation recommended between workflow steps    |
| Checkpoint Integrity          | WAIT for user — never hallucinate completion           |

See references/anti-hallucination.md for full details.

## Multi-Model Compatibility

Works with any AI model in Antigravity:
- 🟣 Claude (Anthropic)      — Guards against polite hallucination
- 🔵 Gemini (Google DeepMind) — Guards against plausible synthesis
- 🟢 GPT (OpenAI)            — Guards against confident fabrication
- 🟡 Open-source models      — Guards against higher baseline hallucination

Model-agnostic by design: uses structural safeguards (file reads,
command verification, user gates) instead of model-specific behavior.
